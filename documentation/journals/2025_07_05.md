- ## Concept: Message Passing
- Function A calls Functions B to modify B's internal state
	- Two kinds: DIrect and indirect
	- Direct is like my current turret logic calling the method directly
	- Indirect is signals
- Compare this too acadmeic OOP which calls everything in main.
	- With this one has a direct reference to everything. But in real oop you dont have direct reference to everything.
