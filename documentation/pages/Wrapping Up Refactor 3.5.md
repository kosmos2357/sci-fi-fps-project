- Finished implementing player state driven inheritance driven system
- Finished Composition and object pool based sound manager
- Finished animation player component for player char
- Finished implementing base classes with func_godot objects, base entity structure, and refactored all entities.
- Added Trigger Areas both one shot and repeat
- Added pressure plate
-
- Now that all has been almost completed with the refactor there remains only 3 more tasks.
	- Light Entity system
	- Grab/Drop/Carry Entity system
	- Fix bugs implemented from refactor particular to player controller
		- NOTE: Both bugs involve changes in logic tied to player nodes. Sol may be to rework entire node structure for player char in regards to crouch logic atleast.
			- Crouch logic
			- Player camera x SOLUTION: spring arm3D then camera3D
			- https://github.com/kosmos2357/sci-fi-fps-project/issues/6 X See commit
			- Ladder trampoline bug X store previous current state
			-
- ## Update
- All that remains is crouching logic
	- But before i do crouching i need to refactor the player node hiearchy to implememnt whatever the easiest layout is for: Goldsrc style movement specifically crouch jumping and crouching
